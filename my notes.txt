rom_start.s (already split)
main.cpp (?)
- NitroMain
    you know what this does
    initialization + main loop
- func_020010e0 (referred in overlay 0 [code - general])
    get VTable(?) D_02045cc4
- func_020010f0 (called from func_020012cc)
    calls some functions from near the end of the code and messes with registers
- func_02001240 (called from NitroMain)
    loads a bunch of... data??? rodata??? not sure wtf this is doin
    uses a bunch of stack space fsr... probably loads a bunch of arguments?
    calls func_0202eef0 right at the end- setting up for the call then?
- func_020012a0 (called from NitroMain)
    messes with IO registers
    likely handwritten? (some optimizations seem too human)
- func_020012cc (called from NitroMain)
    even more IO register shit
    also a shitton of function calls, most to the end of the rom
- func_020013fc (called from NitroMain)
    bunch of function calls with a bunch of data as arguments
    yeah that's it
    probably just a lot of initializing ngl
- func_02001498 (called from _entry_arm9 (what))
    probably a weak function according to E
    i have no idea what that does but it just feels a tiny bit H
- func_020014a8 (set to somewhere in func_020012cc)
    reads/writes shit from a bunch of unknown ARM9 memory places
    i have no idea what is fuckening
- func_020014e0 (called from func_020139b8)
    returns D_02263cd8.unk4
    another weak function??? maybe???
    idk this doesn't really look like sdk
    im confus


02003568~020036a4 is CList.cpp (thank you E)
