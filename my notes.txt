rom_start.s (already split)
main.cpp (?)
- NitroMain
    you know what this does
    initialization + main loop
- func_020010e0 (referred in overlay 0 [code - general])
    get table D_02045cc4
- func_020010f0 (called from func_020012cc)
    calls some functions from near the end of the code and messes with registers
- func_02001240 (called from NitroMain)
    loads a bunch of... data??? rodata??? not sure wtf this is doin
    uses a bunch of stack space fsr... probably loads a bunch of arguments?
    calls func_0202eef0 right at the end- setting up for the call then?
- func_020012a0 (called from NitroMain)
    messes with IO registers
    likely handwritten? (some optimizations seem too human)
- func_020012cc (called from NitroMain)
    even more IO register shit
    also a shitton of function calls, most to the end of the rom
- func_020013fc (called from NitroMain)
    bunch of function calls with a bunch of data as arguments
    yeah that's it
    probably just a lot of initializing ngl
- func_02001498 (called from _entry_arm9 (what))
    probably a weak function according to E
    i have no idea what that does but it just feels a tiny bit H
- func_020014a8 (set to somewhere in func_020012cc)
    reads/writes shit from a bunch of unknown ARM9 memory places
    i have no idea what is fuckening
end of main.cpp?

probably also in main.cpp now that i think about it??

- func_020014e0 (called from func_020139b8)
    returns D_02263cd8.unk4
    if the function that calls it is sdk then this is another weak func
- func_020014f0 (called from NitroMain twice)
    loads and stores some stuff from unknown parts of ram
    yeah thats it

string functions (alternative to those in the sdk)

- 02001524 - strcpy (char* destination, char* source)
- 02001558 - strncpy (char* destination, char* source, int num)
- 02001598 - strcat (char* destination, char* source)
    first for loop may be an inlined strlen
        update: it is not
- 0203b1f8 - thunk_SDK_strcpy (char* destination, char* source)
    calls 0203b1f8 with a bx r12
- func_020015f0 (char* destination, int num)
    prints that number into the destination pointer as a string
- 02001628 - strlen (char* str)
- 0200165c - strncmp (char* str1, char* str2, int num) -> bool
- func_020016a0 (char* str1, char* str2)
    runs strcmpn infinitely (for loop), returns str1 if it ever returns true, returns 0 if false


02003568~020036a4 is CList.cpp (thank you E)

func_020139b8 - called from overlay_0::func_0227fb30 (entry function for overlay 0)

020301dc - snprintf(char* dest, int dest_size, char* format, ...) -> char*
02030204 - thunk to vsnprintf

0203a3bc - vsnprintf
0203b1dc - SDK_strlen
0203b1f8 - SDK_strcpy 
0203b2c0 - SDK_strcat
0203b2f0 - SDK_strcmp
0203b404 - probably another string operation but [E doesn't] have it labeled
